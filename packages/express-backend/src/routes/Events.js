//Darryl's TODOS
// 1. Look at schemas for events and tasks and rework the form from the frontend to make sure the backend gets the expected data types

// 2. Create the routes for creating a task and event. This will require a get route and a post route
    // 2a. Options to Delete and Update Tasks and events will require a different api route and consequently a new issue

// 3. After finishing the task and event creation and get routes, then we will need to work on writing the handleSubmit function for the form
    // 3a. Double check that we do get token data (email) from the frontend that is sent to the backend as to tie the type of events/task to a user
    
// 4. Write Tests for the routes
